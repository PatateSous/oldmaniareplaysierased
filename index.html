          Today, 14th of December 2025, i took a crucial choice in my life, and chose to pretty much stop playing osu after 6 and a half years of playing.
          This game is truly amazing, it gave me moments where i was super happy, and others where i was awfully sad.
        </p>

        <p>
          This game presented awesome people to me. Really awesome people, if you're intrigued i linked them in my bio in the bottom,
          i even met my girlfriend here !
        </p>

        <!-- color=#ffffff -->
        <p class="strong-white">
          This was an awesome journey but i'll stop osu!std for pretty much forever i think, sadly, with RSI and other issues in my life,
          this game has became a struggle to play.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm very happy my brother introduced this game to me in 2014, when i was only 5, because i didn't know that later on, this game would hit me so much in a good way.
          Also, a little fun fact about me, the first map i played is
          <a class="link" href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/10890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Silent Night
          </a>
          ! Now i'm 16 and i wouldn't be who i am without this game.
        </p>

        <p>
          And now, i decided that i want to try to become a good mapper, that could be useful to the community, just mapping the shit i enjoy and i just want to enjoy life, being more healthy !
        </p>

        <p>
          It's crazy that during those 6 years of playing, i only managed to hit 45k ! But hey, i guess people aren't all progressing super fast!
          I'm happy with my skill and what i became, and after all, i play counter strike now, not osu! But yeah, i had a lot of paths in my osu playing career, if you can call it that.
          I tried being a medal farmer, got a lot of medals and then stopped. I wanted to be a top 50 farmer just for my ego, and got some top 50s, and got sad cause i wasn't good enough, so i quit.
          I wanted to be a god player, but mrekk beat me to it. Being a complishonist also went through my mind, but it left as soon as i saw the amount of maps. And now, i want to become a mapper ! I hope this can work, finally.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love this community, i love everyone that i met here, and i'm happy you guys exist.
        </p>

        <!-- [b]Thank you all.[/b] -->
        <p><strong>Thank you all.</strong></p>

        <p>
          I'm sorry if my english is kinda shit, i'm french after all and i never really learned it..
